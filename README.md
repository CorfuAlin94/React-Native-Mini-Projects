# React-Native-Mini-Projects

This repository is made for all my React Native Mini Projects.

All projects can be found in the branches. The last branch by number will be the most recent one that I am working on. 
As a tracker all the commits will contain the date on which I have last worked on.

# React-Native-Mini-Projects - Branches:

# 1. Prj_1-10

Contains the mini projects and challenges of the Udemy Course - The Complete React Native + Hooks Course

# 2. Yelp-App

Contains a project that brings in by search all the Yelp restaurants in your area (via API fetching). And by selecting a restaurant a new screen will appear with all his details.

This projects idea is from the Udemy Course - The Complete React Native + Hooks Course.

All the dependencies, functionality and styling was done by me (the courses version being deprecated).

It was a good change to read version documentation and make decisions. Hope you will enjoy it as much as I did!
